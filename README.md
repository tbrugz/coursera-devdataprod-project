============================

This repo contains the code & presentation for the final project of the [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) course from Coursera.

The project is a [http://shiny.rstudio.com/](shiny) app that the user is prompted to try to guess the slope and intercept of the regression line of a linear model (`lm`) based on the [iris](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html) dataset.

Based on the slope and intercept values chosen by the user, the app draws the regression line and calculates the mean square error (mse).
